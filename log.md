### Day 1: Jan 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Learn all about Z Shell and helper utilities like oh-my-zsh, z, trash 

**Thoughts** The more I know about Z Shell, the more I like it. It's really user friendly shell in my opinion. Things I like
* Using "tab" one can scan through list of options available for given command. Also you can use any arrow key to select the option you want to. Very fast!
* Write any command and then use arrow key to browse through history of it's execution.
* Themes from oh-my-zsh. I got "cobalt2" theme from https://github.com/wesbos/Cobalt2-iterm. Forked it, updated it's documentation to add more clarity. Created and successfully merged my Pull Request of 2017! Also made changes in forked version specifically for my needs.
* Gone through all (11 videos)[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu8EoSxDXHP7tXPJp5ZmUpuT7sFvrswzf] from (Command Line Power User)[https://commandlinepoweruser.com/]. Very helpful videos to understand z shell.
